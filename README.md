# CSE64K Pattern Generator

This project is a Java program designed to generate a custom ASCII-art-style pattern that spells out **CSE64K** using characters from predefined names. It is a fun and creative exercise to work with Java, lists, and loops.

## Features
- Dynamically generates a pattern spelling **CSE64K**.
- Uses predefined names from different lists to form the letters.
- Demonstrates advanced control structures and list manipulation in Java.

## How It Works
1. The program uses multiple `ArrayList` collections to store predefined names.
2. Characters from these names are dynamically accessed and printed to form the pattern.
3. The output pattern is structured to resemble **CSE64K**.
